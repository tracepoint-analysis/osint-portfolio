# Bellingcat Challenge 002: Climate Question

**Date Completed:** January 9, 2026
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Source:** https://challenge.bellingcat.com/

## Challenge Description

Identify a specific person who asked a question at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30). The challenge provides an image of the person at the conference.

## Methodology

### Initial Analysis

Challenge provides a single image showing a group of people at what appears to be a press conference or panel. The goal is to identify one specific person from this image who asked a question at COP30.

**Initial approach:** Reverse image search to find the source of the image and identify the event context.

### Investigation Steps

1. **Step 1: Reverse Image Search**
   - What I did: Performed Google reverse image search on the provided challenge image
   - What I found: Located matching image on X (Twitter) from @c40cities account
   - Why this mattered: Identified the organization (C40 Cities) and provided context for the event, narrowing down the search parameters

2. **Step 2: Social Media Source Analysis**
   - What I did: Examined the X post from C40 Cities (https://x.com/c40cities/status/1991516049288609805)
   - What I found: Post dated November 20, 2025, contained a link to the full conference on UNFCCC website
   - Why this mattered: Provided direct link to official event page with potential video/documentation

3. **Step 3: Official Event Page**
   - What I did: Followed link to UNFCCC event page (https://unfccc.int/event/c40-cities-climate-leadership-group-bringing-sub-nationals-to-the-table-multilevel-cooperation-for)
   - What I found: Official event page for "C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group: Bringing Sub-nationals to the Table" with video of press conference
   - Why this mattered: Located primary source material (video) where the question was likely asked

4. **Step 4: Video Analysis**
   - What I did: Recognized video structure (panel opening statements followed by Q&A), fast-forwarded to timestamp 24:30 where moderator states "I think we have a question from the audience there"
   - What I found: First audience questioner self-identified by name when asking question
   - Why this mattered: Efficient video navigation technique avoided watching 24+ minutes of opening statements; allowed direct identification of target individual

### Dead Ends

None significant. The investigation flow from image search → social media → official source → video was direct and efficient.

## Tools Used

- **Google Reverse Image Search** - Identified source organization and context for the challenge image
- **X (Twitter)** - Located C40 Cities post linking to official event
- **UNFCCC Event Page** - Accessed primary source video of press conference
- **Video Analysis** - Manual review at key timestamp to identify questioner

## Key Findings

Investigation chain: Challenge image → C40 Cities X post → UNFCCC official event page → Video timestamp 24:30 → First audience questioner self-identification. The entire investigation relied on open-source materials freely available online, demonstrating how conference proceedings and social media provide rich investigative trails.

## Answer

## Lessons Learned

- **Efficient video analysis**: Understanding content structure (opening statements → Q&A) allowed strategic fast-forwarding rather than linear watching, saving significant time
- **Social media as investigative bridge**: X/Twitter posts from official organizations often contain direct links to primary sources that might be harder to find through traditional search
- **Reverse image search reliability**: Google image search remains highly effective for identifying recent, well-documented public events
- **Primary source verification**: Following the chain from social media to official UN documentation ensured accuracy and provided authoritative source material
